Phala Network is a TEE-Blockchain hybrid architecture implementing Confidential Contract. This repo
includes:

- `node/`: the main blockchain built on Substrate
- `phost/`: the bridge daemon to connect the blockchain and
  [pRuntime](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-pruntime)

## Overview

![](docs/static/diagram.png)

The **blockchain** is the central compoent of the system. It records commands (confidential contract
invocation), serve as the pRuntime registray, runs the native token and on-chain governance modules.

**pHost** is a daemon program that connects the blockchain and the pRuntime. It passes the block
data from the chain to pRuntime and passes pRuntime side effects back to the chain.

Plase refer to [plibra-grant-docker](https://github.com/Phala-Network/plibra-grant-docker). It includes both the blockchain and pRuntime.

## Native Build

### Dependencies

<details><summary>Expand</summary>

- Rust

  ```bash
  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
  ```

- Substrate dependecies:

   ```bash
   cd node
   sh ./scripts/init.sh
   ```

- LLVM 10

  ```bash
  wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
  chmod +x llvm.sh
  ./llvm.sh 10
  ```

</details>

### Build the blockchain and bridge

Make sure you have Rust and LLVM-10 installed.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The build script enforces LLVM-9 or newer is used. LLVM-9 is needed because of the wasm port of rust
crypto library, `ring`. We have to compile the C code into wasm while keeping the compatibiliy with
the _current_ rustc.

## Run

1. Launch two local dev nodes Alice and Bob:

    ```bash
    cd node
    ./scripts/console.sh start alice
    ./scripts/console.sh start bob
    ```

    - The datadir is at `$HOME/tmp/(alice|bob)`
    - Can be purged by `./scripts/console.sh purge`
    - The WebUI can connect to Alice at port 9944.

2. Run pHost (please start pRuntime first):

    ```bash
    cd phost
    ./target/release/phost
    ```

## Run with tmuxp

You can launch the full stack (semi-automatically) by:

```bash
tmuxp load ./scripts/tmuxp/three-nodes.yaml
```

Or a 4-node testnet-poc2 setup:

```bash
CHAIN=poc2 tmuxp load ./scripts/tmuxp/four-nodes.yaml
```

[tmuxp](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/en/latest/) is a convinient tool that can bring up a tmux session
with the preconfigured commands running in panes. To play with tmuxp, it also need a tmux installed.
